### README

It is possible to run the notebooks inside pycharm or other offline editor, but it is recommended to use jupyter notebook (or jupyterlab).

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more (see https://jupyter.org/install.html for quick install guide)

Within the notebooks you will find cells that are divided in two types: codes and markdowns.
- Markdowns: exactly like this readme is a simple language that transforms your text into html.
- Code cells: where you can use python commands and check the output right below the cell.

See image "SME_LIB\jupyter_notebooks\img" for example.

Reminders: the model inputs were set in order to access specific folders inside this library. In order to run correctly the notebook make sure that all directory path (for example .xlsx) is being referenced correctly.
